		     	<p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 10%;">Due to tough economic times, fewer people can afford to keep their pets. So the number of homeless animals in and around Springfield is increasing dramatically.</p> 
		     	<p class="paragraph">Pets to Go is a nonprofit, no-kill animal shelter serving the Springfield area. Our mission is to give these homeless animals a second chance through our rescue, shelter, and adoption programs.</p> 
		     	<p class="paragraph">We were founded in 2009 with a few simple goals: save and place cats and dogs in new homes, and educate the public about spaying and neutering their pets.</p>
		     	<p class="paragraph">Weâ€™re now one of the largest no-kill shelters in the state! Each year, Pets To Go helps more than 1,300 cats and dogs/year find permanent homes.</p>
